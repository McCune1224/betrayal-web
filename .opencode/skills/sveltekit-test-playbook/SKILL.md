## What I do
- Show how to set up and organize tests for SvelteKit UI logic and stores
- Offer basic, intermediate and advanced test case layouts (unit, integration, mock WebSocket, etc.)
- Encourage test-driven development and give troubleshooting tips for flaky tests

## When to use me
Reference when building, expanding, or reviewing tests for SvelteKit components, store logic or page routes. Apply in CI before major refactor.

## Example Usage
Applied in `frontend/tests/`, `src/routes/`, and for any SvelteKit UI component with user interaction or state.
