## What I do
- Provide standard recipes for SvelteKit page/component/store structure, and integration with Skeleton UI for layouts and modals
- Patterns for error/documentation blocks, container/layout usage, and accessibility (ARIA/role)
- Examples for validation, user feedback, and Svelte store usage

## When to use me
Reference this skill when creating or reviewing SvelteKit page/components; use to keep UI, error handling, and structure consistent for better onboarding and feature delivery.

## Example Usage
Used in `frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte`, new `src/routes/room/[code]/+page.svelte`, or when adopting Skeleton UI for theming and component scaffolding.
